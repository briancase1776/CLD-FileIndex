# scripts/cld-config.sh
# @brief Shared config loader for the .cld checkers -- defaults plus the
# host repo's optional cld.conf override.
#
# Sourced (never executed) by scripts/symbol-audit/check.sh. It sets every tunable to a default,
# then sources $CLD_REPO/cld.conf if that file exists so a host repo can
# override any of them. This file is the reason the checkers are
# portable: in the repo they were extracted from, every one of these
# values was a hardcoded literal naming that project's vendored trees.
#
# Contract: the caller sets CLD_REPO (the repo root) before sourcing.

# Paths that legitimately carry no index. A grep BRE, alternated with
# \| -- it is passed to plain `grep`, not `grep -E`.
CLD_SKIP_RE='\.git/\|node_modules/\|vendor/\|dist/\|build/'

# .cld files that carry a FILE header but are NOT symbol indexes --
# another domain that borrowed the species token. Empty by default; set
# it to a BRE to exempt them from symbol-audit and from the symbol
# lookup skills (the source repo's notes/the-plan*.cld were exactly
# this).
CLD_NOT_SYMBOL_INDEX_RE=''

# Line-1 tokens symbol-audit accepts as a known non-symbol .cld species.
# FILE and INDEX are built in; list any extra species your repo mints
# here, space separated, or SYM-HDR will block on them.

# SYM-MISS (warn): a source file that declares symbols but has no
# <file>.cld beside it. The extensions to consider, the ERE that counts
# as a declaration, and the trees to leave alone.
