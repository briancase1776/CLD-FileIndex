# @brief Test suite for both .cld checkers: builds throwaway git fixtures
# and asserts that each finding code fires when it should and stays quiet
# when it should not.
#
# Usage: tests/run-tests.sh     (exit 0 = all pass, 1 = any failure)
#
# Each case makes a fresh temp repo, copies the toolkit in, writes a
# fixture tree, runs a checker, and matches the output. A checker that
# silently stops finding things is the failure mode that matters most --
# a gate that never blocks looks exactly like a clean repo.
